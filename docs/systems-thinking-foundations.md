# Systems Thinking Foundations

## What systems thinking is

Systems thinking is the discipline of understanding behavior that emerges from interactions between parts, not from parts in isolation. A load balancer works correctly on its own. An autoscaler works correctly on its own. Put them together without understanding their feedback loop and you get oscillation — the autoscaler adds capacity, the load balancer distributes traffic, latency drops, the autoscaler removes capacity, latency spikes, the autoscaler adds capacity again. The failure is not in either component. It is in the interaction.

Infrastructure and architecture decisions fail the same way. Not because individual technologies are misunderstood, but because the interactions between them — cost mechanics, dependency chains, operational constraints, failure propagation paths — are invisible until too late. This plugin encodes a systems-thinking workflow that makes those interactions visible before they become incidents.

## Core concepts that drive this plugin

### Feedback loops and causal dependencies

Components influence each other in cycles, not lines. A routing policy change affects traffic distribution, which affects capacity utilization, which affects cost, which triggers a policy review. Understanding these loops — which are reinforcing (amplifying change) and which are balancing (resisting change) — determines whether an intervention stabilizes or destabilizes the system.

### Leverage points

Not all interventions are equal. Donella Meadows identified that changing system parameters (quotas, thresholds) has far less impact than changing information flows, feedback loop structures, or the goals the system optimizes for. The plugin's complexity mapping identifies where risk and complexity concentrate — the places where intervention matters most.

### Iceberg model

Surface events (an outage, a cost spike, a failed migration) are the visible tip. Below them sit patterns (recurring failures), structures (feedback loops, incentive misalignment, architectural coupling), and mental models (the assumptions teams carry about how their systems work). Extraction agents dig below the surface of documentation to find the structures and assumptions that drive observable behavior.

### Emergent properties

Some behaviors exist only in the interaction between components, not in any single component's specification. A vendor's API may perform well in isolation but introduce a serialization bottleneck when composed with your event pipeline. A pricing model may look linear in the docs but compound non-linearly at scale breakpoints. These properties cannot be found by reading one document — they emerge from cross-referencing multiple sources against operational context.

### Stock and flow

Costs accumulate. Capacity depletes. Quotas fill. Understanding a system requires tracking both the current state (stock) and the rate of change (flow). A database that handles today's load may not handle next quarter's if ingestion rate outpaces index maintenance. The cost-capacity analyst surfaces these dynamics — not just what things cost now, but how costs behave as scale changes.

### Mental models and bounded rationality

Every prior design encodes decisions made under specific constraints — budget, timeline, team size, technology landscape. Those constraints may no longer hold. Pattern remix works because prior designs contain proven structural decisions worth reusing, but only after explicitly checking which assumptions still apply and which have expired.

### System boundaries

Every analysis must declare what is in scope and what is not. Without explicit boundaries, scope drifts silently, dependencies at the boundary get missed, and findings become unfalsifiable. Every output contract in this plugin includes a "scope reviewed" section for this reason.

## Concept-to-capability mapping

| Concept | In Practice | Plugin Capability | Agent / Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reductionist analysis + holistic synthesis | Separate fact-gathering from conclusion-drawing to prevent premature simplification | Extraction/synthesis separation | All extraction agents (Phase 2) then synthesis agents (Phase 3) |
| Feedback loops and causal dependencies | Map how components influence each other — control planes, data planes, failure propagation | Dependency mapping | `architecture-dependency-mapper`, `/complexity-mapper` |
| Leverage points | Identify where small changes produce disproportionate effects and where complexity concentrates | Complexity heat mapping | `/complexity-mapper`, Complexity Heat Map output |
| Iceberg model | Surface what is below the visible layer: buried caveats, implicit assumptions, undocumented constraints | Deep extraction from source material | `caveat-extractor`, `doc-reader`, `/context-sharding` |
| Emergent properties | Find behaviors that exist only in the interaction between components | Interaction-risk extraction | `caveat-extractor`, Hidden Risk Summary output |
| Stock and flow | Track cost that compounds at scale, capacity that depletes under load, quotas that fill silently | Cost and capacity analysis | `cost-capacity-analyst`, `/complexity-mapper` |
| Mental models and bounded rationality | Prior designs encode constraints that may no longer hold — check before reusing | Pattern reuse with constraint checking | `pattern-remix-planner`, `/pattern-remix` |
| System boundaries | Explicit scope prevents drift and catches missed dependencies at edges | Scope declarations in every output | All output contracts (Scope Reviewed section) |

## Extensibility

Systems thinking includes concepts the plugin does not yet cover: systems archetypes (detecting "fixes that fail" or "shifting the burden" patterns in architectures), causal loop diagrams (visualizing dependency chains as feedback structures), resilience vs. efficiency tradeoffs (how optimization for one degrades the other), and delays as a source of oscillation (why systems overshoot and overcorrect).

These map to future capabilities: incident analysis (causal loops and archetype detection), capacity planning (stock/flow dynamics with delay modeling), and operational readiness assessment (resilience scoring). The architecture — narrow agents, structured output contracts, strict separation of extraction and synthesis — was designed to absorb these extensions without restructuring.
