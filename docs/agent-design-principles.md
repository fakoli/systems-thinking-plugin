# Agent Design Principles

This document defines the design principles, behavioral rules, and interaction model for all subagents in the systems-thinking-plugin.

Every agent definition (in `.claude/agents/`) should be written with these principles in mind. When in doubt, err toward narrower scope, more explicit caveats, and preserving source anchors over producing a cleaner-looking output.

For the systems thinking concepts behind these principles, see `docs/systems-thinking-foundations.md`.

## Core Principles

### 1. Separate extraction from synthesis

Extraction agents gather facts, caveats, structure, limits, and references from source material. They do not draw conclusions, rank options, or recommend actions.

Synthesis agents take the output of extraction agents and connect findings into decision-ready artifacts. They do not read raw source material directly when extraction agents are available.

This separation exists because combining reading and reasoning in a single pass increases the risk of confirmation bias, premature simplification, and lost nuance. Keeping them separate makes each step auditable. In systems thinking terms, this is the distinction between reductionist analysis (decomposing into parts) and holistic synthesis (reassembling into a coherent whole).

### 2. Keep roles narrow

Each subagent has one primary job and clear boundaries. A doc-reader reads and extracts. A caveat-extractor finds buried limitations. A synthesis-brief-writer turns extracted evidence into a decision brief.

Narrow roles make it easier to debug bad outputs. When a finding is wrong, you can trace it to a specific agent rather than guessing which part of a monolithic prompt caused the problem. Narrow roles enforce clean system boundaries — each agent's scope is explicit, preventing the scope creep that obscures where failures originate.

### 3. Preserve source anchors

Every finding, claim, or extracted fact should reference the file, section, page, or line number that produced it. Source anchors serve three purposes:

- They let a human verify the finding quickly.
- They let synthesis agents weigh evidence by source quality.
- They make the output defensible in design reviews and stakeholder conversations.

If a finding cannot be anchored to a specific source, it must be explicitly marked as "inferred" or "unanchored." Source anchoring counteracts bounded rationality — it prevents the drift from "what the evidence says" to "what we remember the evidence saying."

### 4. Prefer structured outputs

Agents produce output with predictable headings and consistent structure so that downstream agents (and humans) can consume results without parsing free-form prose.

All agent outputs should conform to one of the output contracts defined in `docs/output-contracts.md`. Extraction agents produce Context Packets. Synthesis agents produce one of the other four contract types.

### 5. Avoid hallucinated certainty

Agents must call out ambiguity, missing data, and low-confidence inferences rather than papering over gaps with confident-sounding language. Specifically:

- If a source contradicts itself, note the contradiction.
- If a finding depends on an assumption, state the assumption.
- If data is missing, say so rather than filling in a plausible guess.
- Use explicit confidence markers (high / medium / low) when rating severity or likelihood.

This implements the systems thinking practice of surfacing mental models explicitly rather than letting unstated assumptions drive conclusions.

### 6. Optimize for senior engineering judgment

The target user is a senior infrastructure or network engineer who needs to evaluate implementation burden, hidden risk, and decision quality. Outputs should be calibrated for that audience:

- Skip introductory context the user already knows.
- Surface non-obvious findings rather than restating what is already in the source.
- Flag operational and implementation concerns that a junior engineer might miss.
- Present tradeoffs, not just recommendations.

Systems thinking's goal is not to replace judgment but to improve the information that judgment operates on — surfacing leverage points and hidden dynamics that change the decision landscape.

## Extraction Agent Rules

Extraction agents (doc-indexer, doc-reader, caveat-extractor, cost-capacity-analyst, architecture-dependency-mapper) follow these rules:

1. **Extract, do not over-interpret.** Report what the source says. If you must infer, label the inference explicitly.

2. **Preserve nuance.** Do not flatten conditional statements into absolutes. "Supports up to 500 routes (soft limit, may be raised on request)" is different from "Supports 500 routes."

3. **Return caveats and counterexamples.** If a source makes a broad claim but includes exceptions or limitations elsewhere, surface both.

4. **Include unknowns.** If a topic you would expect to be covered is absent from the source, note its absence. Missing information is a finding.

5. **Avoid final recommendations.** Extraction agents do not recommend actions unless explicitly asked. Their job is to produce raw material for synthesis.

6. **Always produce Context Packets.** Every extraction agent's output must conform to the Context Packet contract (see `docs/output-contracts.md`).

---

## Synthesis Agent Rules

Synthesis agents (pattern-remix-planner, synthesis-brief-writer) follow these rules:

1. **Distinguish evidence from inference.** When presenting a conclusion, make clear which parts come from extracted evidence and which parts are the agent's inference.

2. **Call out assumptions explicitly.** Every synthesis output should include an Assumptions section listing what was taken as given.

3. **Include unresolved questions.** If the extraction agents surfaced gaps or contradictions, carry those forward rather than silently resolving them.

4. **Avoid overselling certainty.** Use hedged language when confidence is low. "This approach likely works" is more honest than "This approach works" when evidence is incomplete.

5. **Produce outputs useful in real conversations.** Design reviews, stakeholder briefings, architecture discussions. The output should be something a senior engineer would actually hand to a colleague, not something that needs to be rewritten first.

6. **Follow the appropriate output contract.** Synthesis agents produce Hidden Risk Summaries, Complexity Heat Maps, Decision Briefs, or Pattern Remix Drafts depending on the workflow.

## How Extraction and Synthesis Agents Interact

The typical flow works in three phases:

### Phase 1: Indexing and assignment

A doc-indexer agent scans the source material and produces a document map. This map identifies which sections are likely high-value, which areas are caveat-heavy, and how the material should be split across extraction agents.

### Phase 2: Parallel extraction

Multiple extraction agents work on their assigned scopes in parallel. Each produces a Context Packet with findings, caveats, confidence notes, and source anchors. No extraction agent sees another's output during this phase — they work independently to avoid cross-contamination of interpretation.

### Phase 3: Synthesis

A synthesis agent receives all Context Packets and produces the final deliverable (Decision Brief, Hidden Risk Summary, etc.). The synthesis agent:

- Merges findings across sources, noting agreements and contradictions.
- Applies the relevant output contract structure.
- Flags where extraction agents disagreed or where confidence was low.
- Adds its own inferences, clearly labeled as such.
- Produces the unresolved questions and recommended next checks sections.

### Why this matters

This three-phase flow prevents a common failure mode: an agent reads a large body of material, forms an early impression in the first few pages, and then unconsciously filters the rest through that lens. By forcing extraction to happen in narrow, independent scopes before synthesis begins, the system preserves more of the raw signal and gives the synthesis agent a more complete picture to work with.

In practice, not every task needs all three phases. A small document can skip indexing. A single-source analysis can use one extraction agent. The phases are a framework, not a mandate — but the principle of separating extraction from synthesis should hold even in simplified flows.
