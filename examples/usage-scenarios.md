# Usage Scenarios

Four worked examples showing how to use the systems-thinking-plugin in practice. Each scenario describes the situation, which skill to invoke, what happens under the hood, and what outputs to expect.

---

## Scenario 1: Cloud connectivity option review

### Situation

A team is evaluating multiple connectivity approaches between cloud providers (e.g., dedicated interconnects, SD-WAN overlays, VPN tunnels). They need to understand networking tradeoffs, hidden costs, operational burden, and likely project risks before committing to an approach.

### Recommended skill

Start with **context-sharding** to break down the vendor documentation, then run **complexity-mapper** to surface hidden issues, then **decision-brief** to package findings.

### What happens under the hood

1. **context-sharding** invokes the **doc-indexer** agent, which scans all source documents (vendor PDFs, internal architecture notes, pricing sheets) and produces a document map identifying high-value sections and caveat-heavy areas.

2. **context-sharding** assigns scopes to extraction agents running in parallel:
   - **doc-reader** extracts technical claims, limits, and dependencies from each vendor's networking documentation.
   - **caveat-extractor** pulls out limitations, quotas, exclusions, and buried operational traps.
   - **cost-capacity-analyst** highlights pricing mechanics, throughput assumptions, scaling constraints, and support burden.
   - **architecture-dependency-mapper** maps control-plane, data-plane, routing, and ownership dependencies.

3. Each extraction agent produces a **Context Packet** with findings, caveats, confidence notes, and source anchors.

4. **complexity-mapper** consumes all Context Packets and produces a **Complexity Heat Map** and **Hidden Risk Summary**, identifying where implementation difficulty concentrates and what risks are non-obvious.

5. **decision-brief** takes the extracted evidence and complexity findings and produces a **Decision Brief** with options considered, evidence summary, inferred concerns, top risks, recommended next checks, and unresolved questions.

### Expected outputs

- **Context Packets** (one per extraction agent per source) — raw findings with source anchors
- **Complexity Heat Map** — ranked complexity areas with severity and confidence
- **Hidden Risk Summary** — non-obvious risks, impact areas, assumptions
- **Decision Brief** — stakeholder-ready summary of the connectivity decision

### How to invoke

```
/complexity-mapper

Evaluate the following cloud connectivity options for our multi-cloud environment.
Sources are in reference/vendor_docs/ and reference/previous_designs/.
Constraints: must support BGP, budget ceiling is $X/month, ops team is 2 people.
```

## Scenario 2: Vendor documentation risk scan

### Situation

A vendor's pitch deck and technical documentation look clean, but the team suspects there are buried caveats, quota limitations, region restrictions, operational constraints, and support burden that are not obvious from a surface reading.

### Recommended skill

**complexity-mapper** is the primary skill. If the documentation set is large, start with **context-sharding** first.

### What happens under the hood

1. If the documentation is large (50+ pages or multiple documents), **context-sharding** runs first: **doc-indexer** maps the structure, then **doc-reader** and **caveat-extractor** work assigned sections in parallel.

2. If the documentation is manageable (one document, under 50 pages), skip sharding and go directly to extraction: **doc-reader** and **caveat-extractor** process the full document.

3. **caveat-extractor** is the most important agent in this scenario. It specifically looks for:
   - Soft limits described as hard limits
   - Features described as "supported" that require manual configuration
   - Regional availability gaps
   - Support tier requirements for critical features
   - Pricing that changes at scale breakpoints

4. **cost-capacity-analyst** reviews pricing and scaling sections for hidden cost mechanics.

5. **synthesis-brief-writer** produces a **Hidden Risk Summary** combining all findings, with each risk anchored to the specific page or section where it was found.

### Expected outputs

- **Context Packets** — raw extractions with source anchors
- **Hidden Risk Summary** — buried risks, impact areas, assumptions about vendor claims
- A list of **questions to ask the vendor** — generated from gaps and ambiguities found during extraction

### How to invoke

```
/complexity-mapper

Scan the vendor documentation in reference/vendor_docs/vendor-x/ for hidden risks.
Focus on: quotas, regional limitations, support requirements, pricing at scale.
We are evaluating this vendor for production network connectivity.
```

## Scenario 3: Reusing prior patterns for a new design

### Situation

There is a known-good prior implementation (e.g., a hub-spoke network design, a Terraform module structure, a migration playbook) and a new target problem that is similar but not identical. The team wants a strong first draft that reuses what worked before while adapting to new constraints.

### Recommended skill

**pattern-remix** is the primary skill.

### What happens under the hood

1. **doc-reader** extracts the structure, decisions, constraints, and implementation details from the prior design artifacts in `reference/previous_designs/`.

2. **pattern-remix-planner** (a synthesis agent) receives:
   - The extraction results from the prior design
   - The user-provided target state and constraints
   - Any anti-patterns or things to avoid

3. **pattern-remix-planner** produces a **Pattern Remix Draft** that:
   - Identifies which elements from the prior work transfer directly
   - Identifies which elements need adaptation and why
   - Proposes a concrete approach for the new problem
   - Lists implementation steps in order
   - Flags risks introduced by the adaptation (things that worked in the prior context but might not work in the new one)

### Expected outputs

- **Context Packet** from prior design extraction — what was reusable and what was context-specific
- **Pattern Remix Draft** — the adapted design with implementation steps, constraints, and known risks

### How to invoke

```
/pattern-remix

Prior work: reference/previous_designs/hub-spoke-aws-gcp/
Target: Extend the hub-spoke model to include Azure with a shared transit layer.
Constraints: Azure does not support our current BGP community tagging scheme.
Avoid: Do not replicate the manual failover process from the original design.
```

## Scenario 4: Big repo orientation

### Situation

A repository is too large for one clean reasoning pass. The user (often new to the codebase or revisiting after time away) wants fast orientation: what is in the repo, where the important parts are, where complexity hides, and what to inspect next.

### Recommended skill

**context-sharding** is the primary skill, followed optionally by **complexity-mapper** for deeper analysis of flagged areas.

### What happens under the hood

1. **doc-indexer** scans the repository structure — directories, key files, README files, config files, module boundaries — and produces a document map.

2. **context-sharding** assigns sections of the repo to **doc-reader** agents working in parallel. Each reader covers a module or directory and produces a Context Packet summarizing:
   - What the module does
   - Key dependencies
   - Notable patterns or conventions
   - Likely complexity areas
   - Things that look unusual or inconsistent

3. **synthesis-brief-writer** merges all Context Packets into a **Decision Brief** structured as an orientation document:
   - Repo map (directory structure with annotations)
   - Key modules and their purposes
   - Identified complexity hot spots
   - Recommended inspection targets for deeper analysis

4. Optionally, the user can then run **complexity-mapper** on the flagged hot spots to get a full **Complexity Heat Map** and **Hidden Risk Summary** for specific areas.

### Expected outputs

- **Document map** — repo structure with annotations on what each area contains
- **Context Packets** — per-module findings from parallel extraction
- **Orientation Brief** (Decision Brief format) — key modules, complexity areas, recommended next inspection targets

### How to invoke

```
/context-sharding

Orient me to this repository. I need to understand:
- What the major modules do
- Where complexity is likely hiding
- What I should inspect first

Start with the top-level structure and go one level deep into each major directory.
```

## General notes

- These scenarios can be combined. A vendor evaluation might start with context-sharding, move to complexity-mapper, and finish with decision-brief.
- The skills are designed to be invoked individually. You do not need to run the full chain every time.
- If the source material is small enough to fit in a single context window, you can skip context-sharding and go directly to the relevant analysis skill.
- Always populate `reference/` with your source material before invoking skills. The agents read from those directories.
