# Architecture Risk Review

## When to Use

Use Architecture Risk Review when:

- You need a focused risk assessment of a specific architecture or design — not a full complexity mapping, but a targeted investigation of what can go wrong.
- An architecture has been proposed or is in production and you want to identify failure modes, hidden dependencies, operational limits, and maintenance burden before they become incidents.
- A change is being proposed to an existing architecture and you need to understand the risk surface of the change.
- You want to validate that an architecture can survive its stated failure scenarios and degrade gracefully under load.

Do **not** use Architecture Risk Review when:

- You need a broad complexity analysis covering cost, capacity, and implementation concerns beyond architecture. Use `complexity-mapper` for that.
- The architecture documentation is so extensive that it needs sharding before analysis. Run `context-sharding` first.
- There is no architecture to review — only aspirational goals or early-stage ideas. Recommend solidifying the design first.

## Inputs Required

| Input               | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design artifacts    | Yes      | Architecture diagrams, system design documents, infrastructure-as-code, service definitions, API contracts, data flow diagrams. The more concrete the artifacts, the more specific the risk assessment. |
| Architecture docs   | Yes      | Technical documentation describing the system: component responsibilities, communication patterns, data storage strategy, deployment model, scaling approach.                                           |
| Caveats             | No       | Known limitations, quotas, or constraints already identified. If provided, the review will validate and extend them rather than rediscover them.                                                        |
| Dependency maps     | No       | Pre-existing dependency maps or service catalogs. If not provided, the review will construct them from the design artifacts.                                                                            |
| Operational context | No       | Current operational reality: incident history, monitoring coverage, on-call structure, deployment frequency, rollback capabilities. Significantly improves risk severity calibration.                   |

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Invoke doc-indexer on Architecture Documents

Before running the doc-indexer, check these reference directories for supplementary material:

- `reference/previous_designs/` — prior architecture work that may reveal historical risk patterns or recurring failure modes relevant to this review.
- `reference/vendor_docs/` — vendor documentation covering known limitations, quotas, or service constraints relevant to the architecture under review.

Include any relevant reference materials as additional input to the doc-indexer.

Run the `doc-indexer` agent on all provided architecture documents to produce:

- A component inventory: every named service, database, queue, cache, API, and external dependency.
- A communication map: how components talk to each other (sync/async, protocols, data formats).
- A boundary map: where the system's boundaries are (network boundaries, trust boundaries, organizational boundaries, cloud region/zone boundaries).
- An identification of undocumented areas: components mentioned but not described, integrations implied but not detailed, failure scenarios alluded to but not specified.

Undocumented areas are themselves a risk signal. Log them for inclusion in the final output.

### Step 2: Run caveat-extractor on Architecture-Relevant Sections

Run the `caveat-extractor` agent on sections identified by the doc-indexer as architecture-relevant:

**Extraction targets:**

- **Hard limits**: Connection pools, file descriptor limits, DNS TTLs, certificate expiration, API rate limits, storage quotas, message size limits, timeout configurations.
- **Soft limits that harden under stress**: Autoscaling lag, cold start penalties, connection draining timeouts, retry storm thresholds, circuit breaker configurations.
- **Deprecation and drift risks**: Components on deprecated APIs, libraries approaching end-of-life, infrastructure running unsupported versions, configurations that rely on undocumented behavior.
- **Operational burden**: Components requiring manual intervention, scheduled maintenance windows, manual failover procedures, configuration that must be kept in sync across services.
- **Failure propagation paths**: How a failure in one component cascades. Look for missing circuit breakers, unbounded retry loops, synchronous chains without timeouts, shared failure domains.

For each caveat extracted, require:

- The specific limit or risk.
- The source in the documentation.
- The conditions under which it becomes a problem.
- A severity assessment: Critical (system down), High (degraded service), Medium (increased operational burden), Low (technical debt).

### Step 3: Run architecture-dependency-mapper on Design Artifacts

Run the `architecture-dependency-mapper` agent on the design artifacts to produce a comprehensive dependency analysis:

**For each dependency, map:**

- **Type**: Runtime (required for operation), Build-time (required for deployment), Data (data flows through it), Configuration (settings sourced from it).
- **Direction**: Upstream (we depend on it), Downstream (it depends on us), Bidirectional.
- **Ownership**: Internal (our team), Internal-other (another team in our org), External-vendor (third-party SaaS), External-OSS (open source, community maintained).
- **SLA**: Documented availability target. If no SLA exists, flag this.
- **Failure mode**: What happens when this dependency is unavailable? (Graceful degradation, partial outage, full outage, data loss, silent corruption.)
- **Blast radius**: What else breaks when this dependency fails?
- **Recovery**: How is this dependency restored? (Auto-recovery, manual intervention, redeployment, vendor ticket.)

**Specific patterns to flag:**

- Single points of failure: Components with no redundancy whose failure causes system-wide impact.
- Hidden coupling: Components that appear independent but share underlying infrastructure (same database, same network path, same DNS resolver, same certificate authority).
- Transitive dependencies: A depends on B depends on C, where C's failure mode is not accounted for in A's design.
- Ownership gaps: Dependencies where no team has clear operational responsibility.
- Clock and ordering dependencies: Systems that assume synchronized clocks, ordered delivery, or exactly-once semantics without guaranteeing them.

### Step 4: Invoke synthesis-brief-writer for Hidden Risk Summary

Pass the caveat-extractor output and the dependency map to the `synthesis-brief-writer` agent with instructions to produce a **Hidden Risk Summary focused on architectural risks**.

The synthesis must:

1. **Correlate caveats with dependencies**: A rate limit on Service X is a footnote in isolation but becomes critical when Service Y has a retry-on-failure pattern against Service X.
2. **Identify compound failures**: Scenarios where two individually manageable risks combine to produce a severe outcome. Example: autoscaling lag + connection pool exhaustion = cascading failure.
3. **Assess operational survivability**: For each identified risk, can the current operational posture (monitoring, alerting, runbooks, on-call) detect and respond to it before customer impact?
4. **Rate severity** using a consistent scale:
   - **Critical**: System-wide outage or data loss. Requires immediate architectural remediation.
   - **High**: Significant service degradation. Requires remediation before next major release or scaling event.
   - **Medium**: Increased operational burden or localized degradation. Should be addressed in normal planning.
   - **Low**: Technical debt or minor resilience gap. Track and address opportunistically.

### Step 5: Present Findings with Severity Ratings and Source Anchors

Cross-reference findings against any prior risk summaries or architecture review examples in `reference/examples/` to ensure consistent severity calibration and output format.

Deliver the Hidden Risk Summary with:

- **Executive summary**: 3-5 sentences covering the architecture's overall risk posture and the most critical findings.
- **Risk inventory**: Every identified risk with severity, evidence, and recommended action.
- **Dependency risk matrix**: Visual summary of which dependencies pose the highest risk.
- **Source anchors**: Every finding linked to specific document sections, diagram elements, or code locations.
- **Recommended actions**: Prioritized list of what to fix, investigate, or monitor, ordered by severity and effort.

## Output Format

The output is a **Hidden Risk Summary with architectural focus** conforming to the output contract:

## Failure Modes and Caution Points

| Failure Mode                                         | Signal                                                                                                                                                                   | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture documentation incomplete                | doc-indexer identifies multiple undocumented components or integrations; caveat-extractor returns sparse results for key components                                      | Proceed with available information but prominently flag documentation gaps in the output. List undocumented areas as risks in their own right. Recommend documentation remediation as a high-priority action.                                             |
| Design too abstract for concrete risk identification | Artifacts describe high-level intent ("microservices architecture with event-driven communication") without specifying technologies, configurations, or failure handling | Downgrade the review to a risk questionnaire: list the questions that must be answered before a concrete risk assessment is possible. Present these as the primary output rather than producing a speculative risk inventory.                             |
| Missing operational context                          | No incident history, monitoring coverage, or on-call information provided                                                                                                | Proceed but lower confidence on detectability assessments. Note in every detectability field that the assessment is based on architectural inference, not operational data. Recommend providing operational context for a higher-fidelity review.         |
| Single architecture perspective                      | All documentation comes from one team or one role (e.g., only the development team, no ops or security perspective)                                                      | Flag the limited perspective in the executive summary. Recommend soliciting input from operations, security, and any teams that own upstream or downstream dependencies.                                                                                  |
| Review surface too large                             | Architecture spans more than 15 distinct services or components                                                                                                          | Recommend scoping the review to a specific subsystem or failure domain. Alternatively, run `context-sharding` to split the architecture into reviewable segments, then run architecture-risk-review on each segment with a final cross-segment synthesis. |
| Known caveats provided but outdated                  | User provides caveats that reference deprecated configurations or resolved issues                                                                                        | Validate provided caveats against current documentation. Flag any that appear outdated. Do not carry stale caveats into the risk summary without verification.                                                                                            |
